1. Titles And Headings

The division of this agreement and the insertion of titles and headings are for convenience only and are not for purposes of interpretation.

2. Definitions

The following definitions will apply in these Terms and any reference to the singular includes a reference to the plural and vice versa.

**Active Device:** is the unit by which the usage of the 

Services is measured. An Active Device is a mobile device on which a Registered App has been launched or is running. Each mobile device on which any Registered App has been launched is considered a separate Active Device for billing purposes.

An Active Device is measured per Registered App, 

therefore:

- a single mobile device with two Registered Apps which have been launched during the Billing Period will be counted as two Active Devices;
- a single mobile device with a Registered App which has been launched by four different persons during the Billing Period will be counted as a single Active Device; and
- a person using a Registered App which has been launched on four different devices during the Billing Period will be counted as four separate Active Devices.

  - Total daily and monthly Active Devices seen over time;
  - Device rejection rates;
  - Historical monthly Active Devices over time; and
  - Volume of different Active Device attributes detected.
- the Support Portal - for technical enquiries about the service, and
- the Subscription Portal - allows subscribers to change their subscription plan, update their payment details or terminate their subscription.

- View and manage the public key pins associated with particular endpoints;
- View and manage all application versions that have been registered with the Approov cloud service; and
- View and manage the particular mobile devices that are treated specially by the Approov service.

**Billing Period:** the period between the date on which the Services were first provided to you and the same date in the next month. If that date does not exist in any month (for example, the 31st), then the period shall be deemed to end 

on the last day of that month.

**Client SDK:** an SDK that is built into your Registered App which handles all of the work necessary to attest the Registered App and fetch a token.

**Collected Data:** all non-personal data collected by us when Registered Apps connect to the Approov server as part of 

the authentication protocol, or during the app registration process.

**Confidential Information:** any information that is not public knowledge and that is obtained from the other Party in the course of, or in connection with, the provision and use of the Services. Our Confidential Information includes Intellectual Property owned by us, including the Software. Your Confidential Information includes the Collected Data.

**Force Majeure:** an event that is beyond the reasonable control of a Party and is not caused by the negligence or intentional conduct or misconduct of such Party, and such Party has exerted all reasonable efforts to avoid or remedy such event.

Other than our express obligations under Privacy Policy, we assume no responsibility or liability for your Collected Data, and you are solely responsible for your Collected Data and the consequences of submitting and using it with the Services.

Your specific set of Collected Data will not be provided to any third party in an identifiable form without your consent, unless we conclude that it is required by law, such as to comply with applicable legislation, by any court of competent jurisdiction or by any regulatory or administrative body, or when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, implement a change of control transaction, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request.

In addition to the foregoing, you hereby grant us a non- exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, sublicensable and transferable right to use your Collected Data for internal purposes to operate and improve our Services for you and other customers, and to build and operate new services and products.

2. Privacy Policy

6 Fees And Payments

All amounts and fees stated or referred to are in US dollars (USD) and are exclusive of VAT, which, where applicable, shall be added to your invoice(s) at the appropriate rate.

From time to time, we may offer trials of the Services for a specified period without payment (“Free Trial”). The Free Trial is available to new customers only. You may not register for multiple accounts in order to receive additional Free Trials. CriticalBlue may determine your eligibility for a Free Trial and reserves the right to modify the features of the Free Trial. We may terminate or suspend the Free Trial at any time without notice or liability, to the extent permitted under applicable law.

By entering a credit card number upon registration for the Services, you agree that our Third Party service providers may store your credit card information and you expressly authorize us to charge you applicable Subscription Fees on a recurring basis for the Services provided. You must ensure that your credit card will not be declined. If your credit card expires and you do not cancel the Services, you will remain responsible for paying the Subscription Fees, which will accrue until we receive notice of your cancellation of the Services.

Fees shall be calculated by reference to the total number of Monthly Active Devices per Registered App.

The minimum charge in a Billing Period is one hundred and ninety-eight (198) USD (“Minimum Fee”), this includes the first nine thousand nine hundred (9900) Monthly Active Devices. Additional Active Devices are charged at a rate of 0.02 USD for each Active Device per Registered App. We reserve the right to apply the minimum charge on a per app basis when there are five (5) or more Registered Apps active in your account with different package names but the total number of Monthly Active Devices is still below the minimum level of nine thousand nine hundred (9900). Subscription Fees are calculated on the first day of the current Billing Period and are the sum of the Minimum Fee 

for the current Billing Period and the fees for any additional (above nine thousand nine hundred (9900)) Active Devices from the previous Billing Period.

Subscription Fees will be collected on or around the first day of the new Billing Period by recurring credit card payment from the credit card registered by you when signing up for the Services, unless an alternative method is agreed in writing by both Parties.

The Subscription Term is monthly, unless an alternative term is agreed in writing by both Parties.

We reserve the right to suspend or terminate these Terms, and your right to access and use the Services, if your account falls into arrears. If payment fails, we will contact you by email using your Registered Email Address. If the applicable invoice remains unpaid we will assume that you wish to cancel the Services and we will follow the termination process outlined in clause 12.1 after serving you fourteen (14) days notice via email.

Customised graphs are provided at the end of each Billing Period, reporting on the usage of the Services throughout the Billing Period. Upon receipt of your invoice you have fourteen (14) days to raise any billing queries or disputes with CriticalBlue.

CriticalBlue may offer additional Software features or services from time to time. These may be added to the Services provided by agreement between the Parties.

You agree to indemnify and hold us, our directors, officers, employees and suppliers harmless to the fullest extent of applicable law from any claim, action, demand, loss, liability, damage, cost or expense (including, without limitation, legal fees) arising from or in connection with (i) your breach of these Terms, (ii) your violation of any laws or regulations or third-party rights (such as intellectual property or privacy rights), (iii) any content you have submitted to or through the Services or (iv) any dispute you have or may have with

TO, OR USE OF, THE SERVICES, ANY CONTENT, OR 

ANY THIRD-PARTY SITES AND CONTENT. APPLICABLE LAW MAY NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY OR INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION 

MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. IN SUCH CASES, CRITICALBLUE'S LIABILITY WILL BE LIMITED TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. We attempt to have the Services available and operating effectively at most times but cannot guarantee that they will always be available. The Services may become unavailable 

for a number of reasons, including, without limitation, the performance of maintenance, the implementation of new software, in emergency situations and/or due to equipment 

or telecommunications failures. While we attempt to prevent 

any loss of data, we do not provide any guarantee against 

any loss of data, including, without limitation, any loss of 

data due to equipment or telecommunication failures. We do 

not guarantee complete accuracy in all aspects of the 

Services at all times. Features of the Services contingent on 

App Stores or third-party Service Providers are not 

guaranteed to always be available and are dependent on 

their technologies and policies.

YOU EXPRESSLY ACKNOWLEDGE THAT CRITICALBLUE DISCLAIMS ANY LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES INCURRED BY YOU AS A RESULT OF SANCTIONS IMPOSED BY THIRD PARTIES (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, SUSPENSION OF YOUR USE OF AN APP STORE) BECAUSE OF YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES.

- fraud or criminal conduct; or
- death or personal injury.

11 Confidentiality

Each Party shall hold in confidence the Confidential Information of the other Party.

12 Termination

12.1

You may choose to terminate these Terms and your right to access and use the Services at any time, and for any reason, by informing us through the Approov Portal or by contacting us at sales@approov.io.

Upon termination of the Services, we offer a Transition Service where tokens will continue to be served for a maximum of ninety (90) days from the date of your last successful payment prior to the date of cancellation, provided that you have paid the Minimum Fee for at least one month. The Transition Service is limited to existing 

Registered Apps; you will not be able to register additional mobile applications after termination of the Services. While the Transition Service is active, no attestations will be performed; therefore your Registered Apps will continue to function but the software being used to access your API will not be authenticated.

Either Party may terminate these Terms and your right to access and use the Services if the other Party:

1) breaches these Terms in a material way and the breach 

is not (i) rectified within thirty (30) days of receipt of notice in writing of such breach; or (ii) capable of being rectified; or 

2) becomes insolvent, liquidated or bankrupt; has a 

receiver, administrator, liquidator appointed; becomes 

subject to any form or insolvency action or external administration or ceases to carry on business for any 

reason.

12.2 Access To Collected Data After Termination
